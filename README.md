# Description:  This file contains a pedagogical implementation of multiple Random Walkers on a 2d grid
#               On the left panel, visualise the movement of all RWs simultaneously
#               On the right panel, visualise the historical trajectory of a single walker
#               This file is used in the course Complexity Economics and Agent-based Models
#               Control the speed of the simulation, otherwise patterns change too often and cannot be seen on the screen
#               1. first install streamlit using "pip install streamlit" 
#               2. when you run streamlit, it will open a tab in your default browser with the streamlit application *it works as a webpage hosted at the following URL:  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
